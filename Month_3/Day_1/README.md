# Microsoft Defender for IoT/OT Security

**Hands-on lab workshop, Microsoft Defender for IoT/OT Security.**

# Internet of Things - Microsoft Defender for IoT  HOL

## Architecture Diagram ## 

During this workshop we will be focusing on setting up our Microsoft Defender for IoT sensors, for online alerts and also for offline scenarios.
You will learn how to configure your environment, assess the results, and integrate with SIEM systems like Microsoft Sentinel.
This Hands-on-Lab (HOL) will be focus on securing your facilities. 
It will cover brownfield and greenfield devices (currently not part of the HOL).
The scenario below is one of many you would apply these lessons to, other scenarios are Oil, Gas, Utility, and Energy companies.

## **Microsoft Defender for IoT Vocabulary** ## 

**Sensor**: Linux machine, physical hardware running Microsoft Defender for IoT connected to the network.

**Manager**: Linux machine, physical hardware running Microsoft Defender for IoT connected to the network. It connects to multiple sensors to summarize data, alerts across multiples systems, carries the PCAP Configuration and new updates. Central Manager can be used to update the sensor's version and threat intelligence, can also connect to many SIEM systems if needed.

**IoT**: Internet of Things. Modern, new standard connected devices.

**IIoT**: Industrial IoT.

**OT**: Operational Technology, old equipment and technology (e.g, conveyer belts, PLCs).

**Brownfield devices**: Type of legacy equipment and legacy software that performs discrete function in isolation, usually nobody is willing to modify existing, well-functioning legacy assets. 

**ICS**: Industrial Control systems

**Greenfield devices**: New and smart "cyber-physical systems", supporting new software landscapes such as open communication protocols and open standards such as MQTT, REST APIs, AMQP, OPC-UA, MTConnect and CodeSys.

**SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management

**Section 52**: Microsoft Team dedicated to search for threats in the IoT and OT World.

**PCAP file**: Packet Capture or PCAP (also known as libpcap) is an application programming interface (API) that captures live network packet data from OSI model Layers 2-7.

**Zero Trust Principles**: Assume breach, verify explicitly, use least privilege access (identity at network).

**XDR**: Cross detection and response
