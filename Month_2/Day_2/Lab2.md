## Get started with the building scenario

The sample project used in this tutorial represents a real-world building scenario, containing a floor, a room, and a thermostat device. These components will be digitally represented in an Azure Digital Twins instance, which will then be connected to [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md), [Event Grid](../event-grid/overview.md), and two [Azure functions](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) to enable movement of data.

Below is a diagram representing the full scenario. 

You'll first create the Azure Digital Twins instance (**section A** in the diagram), then set up the telemetry data flow into the digital twins (**arrow B**), then set up the data propagation through the twin graph (**arrow C**).

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/building-scenario.png" alt-text="Diagram of the full building scenario, which shows the data flowing from a device into and out of Azure Digital Twins through various Azure services.":::

To work through the scenario, you'll interact with components of the pre-written sample app you downloaded earlier.

Here are the components implemented by the building scenario AdtSampleApp sample app:
* Device authentication 
* [.NET (C#) SDK](/dotnet/api/overview/azure/digitaltwins/client?view=azure-dotnet&preserve-view=true) usage examples (found in *CommandLoop.cs*)
* Console interface to call the Azure Digital Twins API
* SampleClientApp - A sample Azure Digital Twins solution
* SampleFunctionsApp - An Azure Functions app that updates your Azure Digital Twins graph based on telemetry from IoT Hub and Azure Digital Twins events

### Instantiate the pre-created twin graph

First, you'll use the AdtSampleApp solution from the sample project to build the Azure Digital Twins piece of the end-to-end scenario (**section A**):

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/building-scenario-a.png" alt-text="Diagram of an excerpt from the full building scenario diagram highlighting the Azure Digital Twins instance section.":::

In your Visual Studio window where the *AdtE2ESample.sln* solution is open, run the SampleClientApp project with this button in the toolbar:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/start-button-sample.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio start button with the SampleClientApp project open.":::

A console window will open, carry out authentication, and wait for a command. In this console, run the next command to instantiate the sample Azure Digital Twins solution.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you already have digital twins and relationships in your Azure Digital Twins instance, running this command will delete them and replace them with the twins and relationships for the sample scenario.

```cmd/sh
SetupBuildingScenario
```

The output of this command is a series of confirmation messages as three [digital twins](concepts-twins-graph.md) are created and connected in your Azure Digital Twins instance: a floor named floor1, a room named room21, and a temperature sensor named thermostat67. These digital twins represent the entities that would exist in a real-world environment.

They're connected via relationships into the following [twin graph](concepts-twins-graph.md). The twin graph represents the environment as a whole, including how the entities interact with and relate to each other.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/building-scenario-graph.png" alt-text="Diagram showing that floor1 contains room21, and room21 contains thermostat67." border="false":::

You can verify the twins that were created by running the following command, which queries the connected Azure Digital Twins instance for all the digital twins it contains:

```cmd/sh
Query
```

You can now stop running the project. Keep the solution open in Visual Studio, though, as you'll continue using it throughout the tutorial.

## Set up the sample function app

The next step is setting up an [Azure Functions app](../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) that will be used throughout this tutorial to process data. The function app, SampleFunctionsApp, contains two functions:
* *ProcessHubToDTEvents*: processes incoming IoT Hub data and updates Azure Digital Twins accordingly
* *ProcessDTRoutedData*: processes data from digital twins, and updates the parent twins in Azure Digital Twins accordingly

In this section, you'll publish the pre-written function app, and ensure the function app can access Azure Digital Twins by assigning it an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) identity. Completing these steps will allow the rest of the tutorial to use the functions inside the function app. 

Back in your Visual Studio window where the *AdtE2ESample.sln* solution is open, the function app is located in the SampleFunctionsApp project. You can view it in the **Solution Explorer** pane.

### Update dependencies

Before publishing the app, it's a good idea to make sure your dependencies are up to date, making sure you have the latest version of all the included packages.

In the **Solution Explorer** pane, expand **SampleFunctionsApp > Dependencies**. Right-select **Packages** and choose **Manage NuGet Packages...**.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/update-dependencies-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio showing the 'Manage NuGet Packages' menu button for the SampleFunctionsApp project." border="false":::

Doing so will open the NuGet Package Manager. Select the **Updates** tab and if there are any packages to be updated, check the box to **Select all packages**. Then select **Update**.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/update-dependencies-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio showing how to selecting to update all packages in the NuGet Package Manager.":::

### Publish the app

To publish the function app to Azure, you'll first need to create a storage account, then create the function app in Azure, and finally publish the functions to the Azure function app. This section completes these actions using the Azure CLI.

1. Create an Azure storage account by running the following command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az storage account create --name <name-for-new-storage-account> --location <location> --resource-group <resource-group> --sku Standard_LRS
    ```

1. Create an Azure function app by running the following command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp create --name <name-for-new-function-app> --storage-account <name-of-storage-account-from-previous-step> --consumption-plan-location <location> --runtime dotnet --resource-group <resource-group>
    ```

1. Next, you'll zip up the functions and publish them to your new Azure function app.

    1. Open a terminal like PowerShell on your local machine, and navigate to the [Digital Twins samples repo](https://github.com/azure-samples/digital-twins-samples/tree/master/) you downloaded earlier in the tutorial. Inside the downloaded repo folder, navigate to *digital-twins-samples-master\AdtSampleApp\SampleFunctionsApp*.
    
    1. In your terminal, run the following command to publish the project:

        ```powershell
        dotnet publish -c Release
        ```

        This command publishes the project to the *digital-twins-samples-master\AdtSampleApp\SampleFunctionsApp\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish* directory.

    1. Create a zip of the published files that are located in the *digital-twins-samples-master\AdtSampleApp\SampleFunctionsApp\bin\Release\netcoreapp3.1\publish* directory. Name the zipped folder *publish.zip*.
        
        >[!TIP] 
        >If you're using PowerShell, you can create the zip by copying the full path to that *\publish* directory and pasting it into the following command:
        >
        >```powershell
        >Compress-Archive -Path <full-path-to-publish-directory>\* -DestinationPath .\publish.zip
        >```
        > The cmdlet will create the *publish.zip* file in the directory location of your terminal.

        Your *publish.zip* file should contain folders for *bin*, *ProcessDTRoutedData*, and *ProcessHubToDTEvents*, and there should also be a *host.json* file.

        :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/publish-zip.png" alt-text="Screenshot of File Explorer in Windows showing the contents of the publish zip folder.":::

1. In the Azure CLI, run the following command to deploy the published and zipped functions to your Azure function app:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az functionapp deployment source config-zip --resource-group <resource-group> --name <name-of-your-function-app> --src "<full-path-to-publish.zip>"
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're using the Azure CLI locally, you can access the ZIP file on your computer directly using its path on your machine.
    > 
    >If you're using the Azure Cloud Shell, upload the ZIP file to Cloud Shell with this button before running the command:
    >
    > :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/azure-cloud-shell-upload.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure Cloud Shell highlighting how to upload files.":::
    >
    > In this case, the file will be uploaded to the root directory of your Cloud Shell storage, so you can refer to the file directly by its name for the `--src` parameter of the command (as in, `--src publish.zip`).

    A successful deployment will respond with status code 202 and output a JSON object containing details of your new function. You can confirm the deployment succeeded by looking for this field in the result:

    ```json
    {
      ...
      "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
      ...
    }
    ```

You've now published the functions to a function app in Azure.

Next, your function app will need to have the right permission to access your Azure Digital Twins instance. You'll configure this access in the next section.

### Configure permissions for the function app

There are two settings that need to be set for the function app to access your Azure Digital Twins instance, both of which can be done using the Azure CLI. 

#### Assign access role

The first setting gives the function app the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role in the Azure Digital Twins instance. This role is required for any user or function that wants to perform many data plane activities on the instance. You can read more about security and role assignments in [Security for Azure Digital Twins solutions](concepts-security.md). 

1. Use the following command to see the details of the system-managed identity for the function. Take note of the **principalId** field in the output.

    ```azurecli-interactive	
    az functionapp identity show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-function-app-name>	
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    > If the result is empty instead of showing details of an identity, create a new system-managed identity for the function using this command:
    > 
    >```azurecli-interactive	
    >az functionapp identity assign --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-function-app-name>	
    >```
    >
    > The output will then display details of the identity, including the **principalId** value required for the next step. 

1. Use the **principalId** value in the following command to assign the function app's identity to the **Azure Digital Twins Data Owner** role for your Azure Digital Twins instance.

    ```azurecli-interactive	
    az dt role-assignment create --dt-name <your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance> --assignee "<principal-ID>" --role "Azure Digital Twins Data Owner"
    ```

The result of this command is outputted information about the role assignment you've created. The function app now has permissions to access data in your Azure Digital Twins instance.

#### Configure application settings

The second setting creates an environment variable for the function with the URL of your Azure Digital Twins instance. The function code will use the value of this variable to refer to your instance. For more information about environment variables, see [Manage your function app](../azure-functions/functions-how-to-use-azure-function-app-settings.md?tabs=portal). 

Run the command below, filling in the placeholders with the details of your resources.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp config appsettings set --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-function-app-name> --settings "ADT_SERVICE_URL=https://<your-Azure-Digital-Twins-instance-host-name>"
```

The output is the list of settings for the Azure Function, which should now contain an entry called `ADT_SERVICE_URL`.


## Process simulated telemetry from an IoT Hub device

An Azure Digital Twins graph is meant to be driven by telemetry from real devices. 

In this step, you'll connect a simulated thermostat device registered in [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md) to the digital twin that represents it in Azure Digital Twins. As the simulated device emits telemetry, the data will be directed through the *ProcessHubToDTEvents* Azure function that triggers a corresponding update in the digital twin. In this way, the digital twin stays up to date with the real device's data. In Azure Digital Twins, the process of directing events data from one place to another is called [routing events](concepts-route-events.md).

Processing the simulated telemetry happens in this part of the end-to-end scenario (**arrow B**):

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/building-scenario-b.png" alt-text="Diagram of an excerpt from the full building scenario diagram highlighting the section that shows elements before Azure Digital Twins.":::

Here are the actions you'll complete to set up this device connection:
1. Create an IoT hub that will manage the simulated device
2. Connect the IoT hub to the appropriate Azure function by setting up an event subscription
3. Register the simulated device in IoT hub
4. Run the simulated device and generate telemetry
5. Query Azure Digital Twins to see the live results

### Create an IoT Hub instance

Azure Digital Twins is designed to work alongside [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/about-iot-hub.md), an Azure service for managing devices and their data. In this step, you'll set up an IoT hub that will manage the sample device in this tutorial.

In the Azure CLI, use this command to create a new IoT hub:

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub create --name <name-for-your-IoT-hub> --resource-group <your-resource-group> --sku S1
```

The output of this command is information about the IoT hub that was created.

Save the **name** that you gave to your IoT hub. You'll use it later.

### Connect the IoT hub to the Azure function

Next, connect your IoT hub to the *ProcessHubToDTEvents* Azure function in the function app you published earlier, so that data can flow from the device in IoT Hub through the function, which updates Azure Digital Twins.

To do so, you'll create an *Event Subscription* on your IoT Hub, with the Azure function as an endpoint. This "subscribes" the function to events happening in IoT Hub.

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your newly created IoT hub by searching for its name in the top search bar. Select **Events** from the hub menu, and select **+ Event Subscription**.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/event-subscription-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing the IoT Hub event subscription.":::

Selecting this option will bring up the **Create Event Subscription** page.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/event-subscription-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to create an event subscription.":::

Fill in the fields as follows (fields filled by default aren't mentioned):
* **EVENT SUBSCRIPTION DETAILS** > **Name**: Give a name to your event subscription.
* **TOPIC DETAILS** > **System Topic Name**: Give a name to use for the system topic. 
* **EVENT TYPES** > **Filter to Event Types**: Select **Device Telemetry** from the menu options.
* **ENDPOINT DETAILS** > **Endpoint Type**: Select **Azure Function** from the menu options.
* **ENDPOINT DETAILS** > **Endpoint**: Select the **Select an endpoint** link, which will open a **Select Azure Function** window:
    :::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/event-subscription-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal event subscription showing the window to select an Azure function." border="false":::
    - Fill in your **Subscription**, **Resource group**, **Function app**, and **Function** (**ProcessHubToDTEvents**). Some of these values may auto-populate after selecting the subscription.
    - Select **Confirm Selection**.

Back on the **Create Event Subscription** page, select **Create**.

### Register the simulated device with IoT Hub 

This section creates a device representation in IoT Hub with the ID thermostat67. The simulated device will connect into this representation, which is how telemetry events will go from the device into IoT Hub. The IoT hub is where the subscribed Azure function from the previous step is listening, ready to pick up the events and continue processing.

In the Azure CLI, create a device in IoT Hub with the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub device-identity create --device-id thermostat67 --hub-name <your-IoT-hub-name> --resource-group <your-resource-group>
```

The output is information about the device that was created.

### Configure and run the simulation

Next, configure the device simulator to send data to your IoT Hub instance.

Begin by getting the IoT hub connection string with this command:

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub connection-string show --hub-name <your-IoT-hub-name>
```

Then, get the device connection string with this command:

```azurecli-interactive
az iot hub device-identity connection-string show --device-id thermostat67 --hub-name <your-IoT-hub-name>
```

You'll plug these values into the device simulator code in your local project to connect the simulator into this IoT hub and IoT hub device.

In a new Visual Studio window, open (from the downloaded solution folder) *DeviceSimulator* > **DeviceSimulator.sln**.

>[!NOTE]
> You should now have two Visual Studio windows, one with *DeviceSimulator.sln* and one from earlier with *AdtE2ESample.sln*.

From the **Solution Explorer** pane in this new Visual Studio window, select **DeviceSimulator > AzureIoTHub.cs** to open it in the editing window. Change the following connection string values to the values you gathered above:

```csharp
iotHubConnectionString = <your-hub-connection-string>
deviceConnectionString = <your-device-connection-string>
```

Save the file.

Now, to see the results of the data simulation that you've set up, run the **DeviceSimulator** project with this button in the toolbar:

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/start-button-simulator.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio start button with the DeviceSimulator project open.":::

A console window will open and display simulated temperature telemetry messages. These messages are being sent to IoT Hub, where they're then picked up and processed by the Azure function.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/console-simulator-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console output of the device simulator showing temperature telemetry being sent.":::

You don't need to do anything else in this console, but leave it running while you complete the next steps.

### See the results in Azure Digital Twins

The *ProcessHubToDTEvents* function you published earlier listens to the IoT Hub data, and calls an Azure Digital Twins API to update the `Temperature` property on the thermostat67 twin.

To see the data from the Azure Digital Twins side, go to your Visual Studio window where the *AdtE2ESample.sln* solution is open and run the SampleClientApp project.

In the project console window that opens, run the following command to get the temperatures being reported by the digital twin thermostat67:

```cmd
ObserveProperties thermostat67 Temperature
```

You should see the live updated temperatures from your Azure Digital Twins instance being logged to the console every two seconds.

>[!NOTE]
> It may take a few seconds for the data from the device to propagate through to the twin. The first few temperature readings may show as 0 before data begins to arrive.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/console-digital-twins-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console output showing log of temperature messages from digital twin thermostat67.":::

Once you've verified the live temperatures logging is working successfully, you can stop running both projects. Keep the Visual Studio windows open, as you'll continue using them in the rest of the tutorial.

## Propagate Azure Digital Twins events through the graph

So far in this tutorial, you've seen how Azure Digital Twins can be updated from external device data. Next, you'll see how changes to one digital twin can propagate through the Azure Digital Twins graph—in other words, how to update twins from service-internal data.

To do so, you'll use the *ProcessDTRoutedData* Azure function to update a Room twin when the connected Thermostat twin is updated. The update functionality happens in this part of the end-to-end scenario (**arrow C**):

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/building-scenario-c.png" alt-text="Diagram of an excerpt from the full building scenario diagram highlighting the section that shows the elements after Azure Digital Twins.":::

Here are the actions you'll complete to set up this data flow:
1. [Create an event grid topic](#create-the-event-grid-topic) to enable movement of data between Azure services
1. [Create an endpoint](#create-the-endpoint) in Azure Digital Twins that connects the instance to the event grid topic
1. [Set up a route](#create-the-route) within Azure Digital Twins that sends twin property change events to the endpoint
1. [Set up an Azure function](#connect-the-azure-function) that listens on the event grid topic at the endpoint, receives the twin property change events that are sent there, and updates other twins in the graph accordingly

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-twin-to-twin-resources.md](../../includes/digital-twins-twin-to-twin-resources.md)]

### Connect the Azure function

Next, subscribe the *ProcessDTRoutedData* Azure function to the event grid topic you created earlier, so that telemetry data can flow from the thermostat67 twin through the event grid topic to the function, which goes back into Azure Digital Twins and updates the room21 twin accordingly.

To do so, you'll create an Event Grid subscription that sends data from the event grid topic that you created earlier to your *ProcessDTRoutedData* Azure function.

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to your event grid topic by searching for its name in the top search bar. Select **+ Event Subscription**.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/event-subscription-1b.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Azure portal showing how to create an Event Grid event subscription.":::

The steps to create this event subscription are similar to when you subscribed the first Azure function to IoT Hub earlier in this tutorial. This time, you don't need to specify **Device Telemetry** as the event type to listen for, and you'll connect to a different Azure function.

On the **Create Event Subscription** page, fill in the fields as follows (fields filled by default aren't mentioned):
* **EVENT SUBSCRIPTION DETAILS** > **Name**: Give a name to your event subscription.
* **ENDPOINT DETAILS** > **Endpoint Type**: Select **Azure Function** from the menu options.
* **ENDPOINT DETAILS** > **Endpoint**: Select the **Select an endpoint** link, which will open a **Select Azure Function** window:
    - Fill in your **Subscription**, **Resource group**, **Function app**, and **Function** (**ProcessDTRoutedData**). Some of these values may auto-populate after selecting the subscription.
    - Select **Confirm Selection**.

Back on the **Create Event Subscription** page, select **Create**.

## Run the simulation and see the results

Now, events should have the capability to flow from the simulated device into Azure Digital Twins, and through the Azure Digital Twins graph to update twins as appropriate. In this section, you'll run the device simulator again to kick off the full event flow you've set up, and query Azure Digital Twins to see the live results

Go to your Visual Studio window where the *DeviceSimulator.sln* solution is open, and run the DeviceSimulator project.

Like when you ran the device simulator earlier, a console window will open and display simulated temperature telemetry messages. These events are going through the flow you set up earlier to update the thermostat67 twin, and then going through the flow you set up recently to update the room21 twin to match.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/console-simulator-telemetry.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console output of the device simulator showing temperature telemetry being sent.":::

You don't need to do anything else in this console, but leave it running while you complete the next steps.

To see the data from the Azure Digital Twins side, go to your Visual Studio window where the *AdtE2ESample.sln* solution is open, and run the SampleClientApp project.

In the project console window that opens, run the following command to get the temperatures being reported by both the digital twin thermostat67 and the digital twin room21.

```cmd
ObserveProperties thermostat67 Temperature room21 Temperature
```

You should see the live updated temperatures from your Azure Digital Twins instance being logged to the console every two seconds. Notice that the temperature for room21 is being updated to match the updates to thermostat67.

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/console-digital-twins-telemetry-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the console output showing a log of temperature messages, from a thermostat and a room.":::

Once you've verified the live temperatures logging from your instance is working successfully, you can stop running both projects. You can also close the Visual Studio windows, as the tutorial is now complete.

## Review

Here's a review of the scenario that you built out in this tutorial.

1. An Azure Digital Twins instance digitally represents a floor, a room, and a thermostat (represented by **section A** in the diagram below)
2. Simulated device telemetry is sent to IoT Hub, where the *ProcessHubToDTEvents* Azure function is listening for telemetry events. The *ProcessHubToDTEvents* Azure function uses the information in these events to set the `Temperature` property on thermostat67 (**arrow B** in the diagram).
3. Property change events in Azure Digital Twins are routed to an event grid topic, where the *ProcessDTRoutedData* Azure function is listening for events. The *ProcessDTRoutedData* Azure function uses the information in these events to set the `Temperature` property on room21 (**arrow C** in the diagram).

:::image type="content" source="media/tutorial-end-to-end/building-scenario.png" alt-text="Diagram of the full building scenario, which shows the data flowing from a device into and out of Azure Digital Twins through various Azure services.":::

## Clean up resources

After completing this tutorial, you can choose which resources you want to remove, depending on what you want to do next.

[!INCLUDE [digital-twins-cleanup-basic.md](../../includes/digital-twins-cleanup-basic.md)]

* If you want to continue using the Azure Digital Twins instance you set up in this article, but clear out some or all of its models, twins, and relationships, you can use the [az dt](/cli/azure/dt) CLI commands to delete the elements you want to remove.

    This option won't remove any of the other Azure resources created in this tutorial (IoT Hub, Azure Functions app, and so on). You can delete these individually using the [dt commands](/cli/azure/reference-index) appropriate for each resource type.

You may also want to delete the project folder from your local machine.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an end-to-end scenario that shows Azure Digital Twins being driven by live device data.

Next, start looking at the concept documentation to learn more about elements you worked with in the tutorial:
